# BMI_CALCI
This is a small sample project I've done in partnership with my friend and College mate SOUVIK NAYAK.Body Mass Index (BMI) is a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. A high BMI can be an indicator of high body fatness. BMI can be used to screen for weight categories that may lead to health problems but it is not diagnostic of the body fatness or health of an individual.
